# Some fun high school projects

In this repo, I uploaded several small and medium-sized projects that I did for school and for myself. The quality of the code can be terrible and contain a bunch of workarounds, but at that time it wasn't so important to me, sorry. Hopefully, you will find something interesting here.

## JavaScript section 

### Paint
A simple drawing site that allows you to choose colors from a set of RGB, draw lines and squares, change the size of the brush. Made with JS canvas and onmouse events. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Paint/)


### Hypnotoad
A hypnotoad with only one working hypnotic eye. The result of some experiments with WebGL2. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Hypnotoad/)

### Clock
Rendered using canvas 2D context and a pinch of math. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Clock/)


### Marching squares
A visual demonstration of the work of an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) popular in the field of computer graphics. Is a simplification of the [marching cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) for the flat case. You can try "special mode", it's a little satisfying.

## Neural networks and Z3








### Euclidean algorithm
Two integers a >= 0 and b >= 0 are supplied to the input via a space character. It is also guaranteed that b > a.
Print all prime numbers between a (inclusive) and b (exclusive) in ascending order.
