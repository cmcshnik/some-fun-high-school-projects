# Some fun high school projects

In this repo, I uploaded several small and medium-sized projects that I did for school and for myself. The quality of the code can be terrible and contain a bunch of workarounds, but at that time it wasn't so important to me, sorry. Hopefully, you will find something interesting here.

### Marching squares
A visual demonstration of the work of an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares) popular in the field of computer graphics. Is a simplification of the [marching cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes) for the flat case. You can try "special mode", it's a little satisfying.

### Paint
A simple drawing site that allows you to choose colors from a set of RGB, draw lines and squares, change the size of the brush. Made with JS canvas and onmouse events. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Paint/)


### Hypnotoad
A hypnotoad with only one working hypnotic eye. The result of some experiments with WebGL2. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Hypnotoad/)

### Clock
Rendered using canvas 2D context and a pinch of math. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Clock/)


### Messenger with python server
Done using python http.server and Sqlite3 on the server side, and using js fetch on the client side.



## Neural networks and Z3

### First neural network
It can determine the gender of a noun in the Russian language. It is written using two features of the Torch library: working with tensors and automatic calculation of derivatives. For the neural network to work, you can either train it yourself using the file nn.py and the data set russian_nouns.txt, or use saved_model.txt and immediately launch start.py.

### MNIST
A neural network that can detect handwritten numbers. It is written with the help of already more Torch functionality than the previous one. There is no interactive mode, but there is the possibility of learning from scratch. For the test, you need to run the file start.py.

## HTML & CSS

### Sudoku solver
A program that solves Sudoku using python Z3. At the entrance, she needs to submit 81 numbers, where each consecutive 9 numbers is another row of the entire square. In order to try Sudoku with a photo, you need to enter 000000010400000000020000000000050407008000300001090000300400200050100000000806000

### Portfolio site
A portfolio website for a programmer with interactive buttons. The design is the same as in the olim.p project. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Portfolio%20site/)


### Site for MIREA
The website for the project, which was planned to be shown at the technological conference of the Russian university MIREA. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Site%20for%20MIREA/)


### Tech leaders site
Just experiments with a dark design style. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Tech%20leaders%20site/)


### Amongus site
Yeah, amongus site. [Link](https://cmcshnik.github.io/some-fun-high-school-projects/Amongus%20site/)
